# Project Proposal for a Soil Moisture Sensor with Auditory Feedback Using STM32L4 Cortex-M4 and TL555 Timer

## Introduction

In this final project for our EE14 Embedded Systems course, we, Senri Nakamura and Brian Kim, aim to innovate traditional soil moisture detection by developing a system that utilizes a TL555 timer-based circuit interfaced with the STM32L4 Cortex-M4 microcontroller. This system is designed to monitor soil moisture levels accurately, providing essential information for applications in agriculture, gardening, and environmental monitoring. Our unique approach incorporates auditory feedback to convey soil moisture status, facilitating use in various lighting conditions, including complete darkness.

## Background and Functionality

Effective moisture management is crucial for the vitality of crops and the sustainability of environmental ecosystems. While existing solutions typically rely on visual or digital displays, our project seeks to convey soil moisture levels through auditory feedback. This method aims to enhance usability for individuals with visual impairments and in scenarios where visual monitoring is impractical. Moreover, this sensor could be implemented in automated vertical farming.

Leveraging the TL555 timer's versatility, we plan to simulate soil moisture conditions, translating them into auditory signals generated by the STM32L4 microcontroller. This application of the TL555 timer allows for a robust, corrosion-resistant system capable of providing immediate and intuitive feedback about soil conditions through changes in sound frequency, pitch, or volume.

## Technical Approach/Framework

### Core Components

- STM32L4 Cortex-M4 Microcontroller
- TL555 Timer Circuit
- Speaker for auditory feedback (CL0201MA)

### Functionality

1. **TL555 Timer Circuit Simulation**: The TL555 is configured to simulate variable soil moisture conditions by generating frequencies or pulse widths that mimic the analog output you'd expect from a traditional soil moisture sensor.
2. **STM32L4 Interface**: The microcontroller reads the TL555's output, interpreting these signals to determine simulated moisture levels.
3. **Auditory Feedback**: Based on this interpretation, the STM32L4 activates the speaker to emit sounds that correspond to the detected moisture level, with unique tones indicating dry, moist, or wet soil conditions.
